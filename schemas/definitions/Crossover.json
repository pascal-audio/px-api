  "description": "Crossover filter with independent high-pass and low-pass filters.\n\n# Internal Type Used in **preset processing layer only**. User and array layers do NOT have crossover. Path: `/audio/output/speaker/1/preset/crossover`\n\n# Critical: Layer Availability - ✅ Preset layer: Has crossover (from factory presets)\n\n# Purpose Frequency-splits signal for multi-way speaker systems. Factory presets configure appropriate crossover points for LF, MF, HF drivers based on speaker model.\n\n# Structure - `gain`: Crossover gain adjustment (-20.0 to +20.0 dB) - `lpf`: Low-pass filter type (Butterworth, Linkwitz-Riley, Bessel, Off) - `lpf_freq`: Low-pass corner frequency (20.0-20000.0 Hz) - `hpf`: High-pass filter type (Butterworth, Linkwitz-Riley, Bessel, Off) - `hpf_freq`: High-pass corner frequency (20.0-20000.0 Hz) - `bypass`: Bypass both filters\n\n# Filter Types Each filter supports multiple slopes (6/12/24/36/48 dB/octave) and topologies: - Butterworth (But): Maximally flat passband - Linkwitz-Riley (LR): Ideal for multi-way systems (constant power sum) - Bessel (Bes): Linear phase, minimal ringing\n\n# Factory Defaults - Gain: 0 dB - Both filters: Off - Frequencies: 20 Hz (HPF), 20 kHz (LPF) - full bandwidth when enabled",
