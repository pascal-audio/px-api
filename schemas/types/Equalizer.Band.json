  "description": "Single parametric EQ band with configurable filter type, gain, frequency, and Q.\n\n# Internal Type This is the internal representation. API consumers should use the JSON-RPC methods to interact with EQ bands via paths like `/audio/output/speaker/1/user/eq/bands/3`.\n\n# Filter Types Supports 9 filter types: Parametric, LowPass6/12, HighPass6/12, LowShelf, HighShelf, AllPass, BandPass\n\n# Structure - `kind`: Filter type (parametric, shelf, pass, etc.) - `gain`: Filter gain in dB (-20.0 to +20.0) - `frequency`: Center/corner frequency in Hz (20.0 to 20000.0) - `q`: Filter Q factor (0.1 to 20.0) - bandwidth control - `bypass`: Individual band bypass\n\n# Patch Type `EqualizerBandPatch` is auto-generated via `#[derive(Patch)]` for partial updates. Used in API responses to indicate which fields changed.",
